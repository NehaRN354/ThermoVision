AI-Powered Hazard Awareness for the Visually Impaired

Overview

ThermoVision is an AI-driven real-time hazard awareness system designed to assist visually impaired individuals by detecting dangerous environmental elements and converting them into clear audio safety feedback.

Instead of relying heavily on specialized hardware, the project emphasizes intelligent computer vision, lightweight deep learning models, and risk-based decision making to enable safe and independent navigation.
